A Telegram bot to download mp3 from You[t]ube by just sending the link to it.

- It uses `yt-dlp` to fetch video info.
- It uses `piscina` for pooling Node.js workers for faster download.
- It uses `p-queue` to queue requests.
- It store files under `/tmp` directory, so it will be disposed after it's done.
- It transcodes audio to mp3
- It cannot send audio larger than 50MB.

```sh
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=
